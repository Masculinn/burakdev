        Here is a little bit about me. I'm a results-driven Full-Stack Mid-Level
        Application Engineer with 5+ years of experience specializing in
        frontend & backend development, particularly with the techs shown below.
        I'm passionate about crafting responsive, high-performing, and
        user-friendly web applications and services. I'm proficient in
        translating client needs into innovative technical solutions, optimizing
        for performance, and ensuring seamless cross-browser compatibility while
        maintaining scalability. I chose to pursue independent learning and
        professional development after graduating from my Computer Engineering
        degree program at Managerial Academy of Applied Sciences in Warsaw
